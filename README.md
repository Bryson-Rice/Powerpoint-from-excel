## Powerpoint-from-excel

Simple python script that extracts embedded powerpoints from a Excel document.

This was originally a bash script that I used while in training for tech support for the US Army, the bash script converted the Excel file to a .zip and would then exact the new .zip and do some basic clean up.

But I wanted to use that idea as a learning opportunity to improve my python skills. So now there is this fancy python script to slove a super niche problem.

Usage: `python3 PowerPoint-Extractor.py -f FILE -o OUTPUT-FOLDER`
